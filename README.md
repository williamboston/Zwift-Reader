# Zwift-Reader

W.I.P.

Currently takes .fit files recorded with Zwift and outputs some important ride data.

Further improvements:
  - Finish UI
  - Ability to log multiple days
  - User/account set up
  - Graphing component
  - Expansion into fields I'm not familiar with (HR, Vo2, W/bal)

Development currently on hiatus.
