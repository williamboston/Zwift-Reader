# Zwift-Reader

A little holiday exercise to learn more about fit files and UI in C#.

Once open, load a fit file recorded in Zwift.

Current Data Ouput:
  - Average Ride Power
  - Average Ride Cadence
  - Average Ride Speed
  - Estimated FTP
  - Ride Time
  - Alt Gained
  - Peak Power
  - Peak Cadence
  - Top Speed
  - Est. Calories
  - Incline Data
  - 1second -> 5hour Critical Power
  - Active/Inactive Breakdown
  - Slope/Gradient Metrics

TODOs:
  - Clean up UI
  - DB logging (local account)
  - User/account set up
  - CP Graph
  - Expansion into data fields I'm not familiar with (HR, Vo2, W/bal)

Notes: 
  - Currently only designed for .fit files recorded in Zwift, but it will take Garmin/Wahoo files and output some data, but it wasn't ever   intended to do that so results may vary.
  - Development currently on hiatus.
